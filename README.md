# UNILINK
C++ is used to implement the console-based messaging program **UNILINK**. The project's main objectives are secure communication, effective message handling using linked lists, and user account management. In addition to sending and receiving messages, users can register accounts, log in, and carry out operations like staring, deleting, and searching messages. The application uses a doubly linked list for user administration and singly linked lists for sent and received messages. Error management, password security, and a garbage mechanism for erased communications are important aspects.
